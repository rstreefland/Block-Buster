# Block-Buster
An Android game that I created as coursework for my second year Java module to learn Android app development. I only had a few days to write it and never intended for it to make it onto the Play Store so it still has a lot of rough edges, a few bugs, and 'borrows' the Minecraft theme. I can't imagine me doing any more work on this game (partly because of the Minecraft element) so I've decided to make it public so hopefully other people can learn from it as well!

I made this code public as an example of what can be achieved with the University of Reading's Begin Programming MOOC at https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/begin-programming

I'm willing to share my project report and documentation to interested parties on a case by case basis. Please email me at rhysaled.streefland@ntlworld.com if you'd like a copy.
